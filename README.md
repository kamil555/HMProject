Abstract:
We propose an application where UW students can find required text books for
rent/sale, from other UW students. This app will enable students to get text books at a
potentially significant discount, when compared to other stores or resources. Students will be
able to search and contact textbook owners, also owners will be able to post their books quickly
and easily.

Introduction:
With “Find my Book” we propose UW students will be able to connect with other UW
students who have the book they need. As a UW student you will be able to register as a user,
then have access to a database of books available for rent or buy. Students will also be able to
put a book up for sale or rent.
We propose with this app students will not have to spend precious time finding books
they need for next quarter quickly and more importantly as cheaply as possible. Also at the end
of the quarter if a student decides they do not want last quarter’s books they can sell, or maybe
even rent the book out and make a few dollars off it.
As an interested searcher, students will be able to search for books by major, by book
title, or by ISBN number. This will return a list of all books that match your search criteria with
Book title, book ISBN number, the owner of book and contact information, campus location of
book and book status (rent/buy and condition). If the searcher finds a book they are interested
in they will then be able to contact the book owner via email, text or phone.
As a book owner, you will be able to Post what books you want to rent/sell as well as
what major you are taking. Your contact information will also be posted to each book you have
listed so potential buyer/renters will only see your contact information when they find one of
your books. This is done to try to limit unwanted people contacting you for no reason.
Background:
The only way for current students to find a book for class is either:
1) Go to the local UW store, hope the book they need is not been sold out. Find a used version
that is expensive or find a new version that is terribly overpriced, then potentially stand in line
for 30 minutes or more.
2) Drive to some obscure book store several miles away and hope they can find a cheaper book.
3) Go online and rent or buy the book and hope it is mailed to you in a timely manner.
For the current UW student they might have a very short amount of time to prepare for
next quarter, because they might have jobs, social life, activities or other obligations that they
are trying to juggle on top of requirements needed to prepare for school. Getting ready for
classes next quarter can be difficult and time consuming and the last thing you should need to
worry about is where can I get my books and how am I going to pay for them.
We propose with this app students can deal with students and not have to pay the
overhead associated with stores and profit. This also is also a good chance for students to talk
to other students about their upcoming class and practical reviews about the book they are
about to buy or rent. We propose for the potentially busy student, this app will give them a
quick, direct and potentially cheap way to get the materials needed for class in a timely and
easy manner.
